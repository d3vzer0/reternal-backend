---------------------

RE:TERNAL is a centralised purple team simulation platform. Reternal uses agents installed on a simulation network to execute various known
red-teaming techniques in order to test blue-teaming capabilities. The simulations are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This repo contains
parts of the back-end API writtin in Python (with the help of Flask and Celery). Since the project is still in development, please do not run this in production or on an exposed interface yet.

#### Reternal components
- **API:** https://github.com/d3vzer0/reternal-backend.git
- **UI:** https://github.com/d3vzer0/reternal-ui.git
- **Agent:** https://github.com/d3vzer0/reternal-agent.git
- **Quickstart:** https://github.com/d3vzer0/reternal-quickstart.git

#### Component installation
Reternal components are primarily aimed to be run as docker containers since the component configuration depends on environment variables set by docker-compose or the dockerfile. A docker-compose with all the default options can be found on the reternal-quickstart repository. If you don't want to run the service within containers, adjust the config.py files with your own custom values.

#### Pre-Requirements
  - MongoDB
  - Redis (for task queuing)
  - Celery (for task management)
  - Python v3.6
  - Flask and +- 20 PIP modules (found in requirements file)

#### Feature Requests & Bugs
We use the Github to manage Feature requests and Bug reports.

#### Whats up with the name?

This project has been re-developed so many times, it will probably never really finish. Hence RE (Redo) and Ternal (Eternal).
