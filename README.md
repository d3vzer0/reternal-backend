---------------------

RE:TERNAL is a centralised purple team simulation platform. Reternal uses agents installed on a simulation network to execute various known
red-teaming techniques in order to test blue-teaming capabilities. The simulations are mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This repo contains
parts of the back-end API writtin in Python (with the help of FastAPI and Celery).
